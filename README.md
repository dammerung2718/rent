# `rent` - Suckless Presentations for macOS

This is a macOS clone of suckless utility `sent`.
For usage [visit here](https://tools.suckless.org/sent/).


## Why?

I really liked sent, but I have been using macOS for a couple years now and also like it.
I needed a presentation tool for my future youtube videos and wanted to use `sent`.

Hi youtube!
