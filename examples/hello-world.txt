Hello World

This is a presentation using the Takahashi method

It is a technique of deploying extremely
simple and distilled visual slides for presentations.

Once Takahashi, a programmer, had to give a short presentation at a conference (RubyConf)

So he first used the method and found it helpful

There is this beautiful tool called sent

I really like it, but there is not equivalent on macOS.

So I built one...

It is named rent (lmao)
